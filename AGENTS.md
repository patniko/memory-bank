# Agent Guidance Refresh - core loop responsible for initial guidance on session start

Make sure AGENTS.md stays up to date!
Do not forget to update AGENTS.md when appropriate or it makes sense! llm-quick-reference is used by software developers and AI LLM agents to quickly understand the project, it's goals, technical architecture and standards to minimize discovery required when trying to understand the project and identify where to make changes.

Read quick reference for context!
Make sure you have read AGENTS.md for context on this specific project.

Try to keep files under 1500 lines of code!
I like compact files that are easy to navigate by filename, folder structure and code naming conventions. Keep things consistent so they can be easily found based on logical groups or specific pointers in the AGENTS.md document. 

Be consistent when creating new documents!
If there are existing documents in a folder, keep consistent naming conventions and file content structure if it makes sense for the content you are saving. Do not deviate duplicate similar content in two different folders. Make it easy to discover using tools such as find, grep, sed, awk, cat.
