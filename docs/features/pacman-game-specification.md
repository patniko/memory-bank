# Pacman Game Feature Specification

## Overview
Implementation of a high-quality, mobile-responsive Pacman game for the memory-bank repository.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Core Gameplay**: Classic Pacman mechanics with player, ghosts, pellets, and power pellets
- **Scoring System**: Points for pellets consumed and ghosts eaten
- **Level Progression**: Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- **Game States**: Start screen, gameplay, pause, game over, and victory states

### Non-Functional Requirements  
- **Performance**: Smooth 60fps gameplay on mobile and desktop
- **Responsiveness**: Adapts to various screen sizes (mobile-first approach)
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard and touch controls
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript implementation following project conventions
- **File Structure**: Modular, maintainable code under 1,500 lines per file

## Technical Specifications

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5 Canvas with TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS3 with responsive design
- **Build**: TypeScript compiler with modern ES modules
- **Testing**: Jest for unit testing (if test infrastructure exists)

### Game Architecture
```
Game Engine
├── GameState Manager    # Handles game states and transitions
├── Renderer            # Canvas rendering system
├── Input Manager       # Keyboard and touch input handling
├── Collision Detection # Entity collision system
└── Audio Manager       # Sound effects and music
```

### Entity System
```
Entities
├── Player              # Pacman character with movement and state
├── Ghost               # AI-controlled enemies with different behaviors
├── Pellet              # Collectible items for scoring
├── PowerPellet         # Special items that enable ghost eating
└── Maze                # Static maze structure and collision boundaries
```

## User Experience

### Controls
- **Desktop**: Arrow keys or WASD for movement, spacebar for pause
- **Mobile**: Touch swipe gestures for direction, tap for pause
- **Accessibility**: Clear visual feedback and responsive controls

### Visual Design
- **High Fidelity**: Smooth animations, particle effects for eating pellets
- **Responsive Layout**: Scales appropriately for different screen sizes
- **Color Scheme**: Classic Pacman colors with modern visual polish
- **UI Elements**: Clean, minimal interface that doesn't distract from gameplay

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Set up TypeScript build environment
2. Create HTML5 Canvas setup with responsive sizing
3. Implement basic game loop and rendering system
4. Add input handling for keyboard and touch

### Phase 2: Game Entities
1. Implement Pacman player character with movement
2. Create maze structure and collision detection
3. Add pellets and power pellets
4. Implement basic ghost AI

### Phase 3: Game Logic
1. Add scoring system and level progression
2. Implement game states (start, pause, game over)
3. Add sound effects and visual feedback
4. Optimize performance for mobile devices

### Phase 4: Polish and Testing
1. Fine-tune responsive design
2. Add accessibility features
3. Test across different devices and browsers
4. Documentation and code cleanup

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Game runs smoothly on mobile and desktop browsers
- ✅ Responsive design works on screens from 320px to 1920px wide
- ✅ Code follows TypeScript and naming conventions
- ✅ All files under 1,500 lines
- ✅ High-fidelity visual design matches quality standards
- ✅ Touch and keyboard controls work intuitively

## Future Enhancements
- Multiplayer support
- Level editor
- Achievement system
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Additional game modes
