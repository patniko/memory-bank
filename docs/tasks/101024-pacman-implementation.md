# Pacman Game Implementation Tasks

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Task Overview
Successfully implemented a high-quality, mobile-responsive Pacman game following the memory-bank project conventions.

## Implementation Checklist

### ✅ Phase 1: Project Setup and Documentation
- [x] Create agent-memory-bank.md with project context
- [x] Create feature specification document
- [x] Create task tracking document
- [x] Set up TypeScript build environment
- [x] Create basic project structure

### ✅ Phase 2: Core Infrastructure  
- [x] Create package.json with TypeScript dependencies
- [x] Set up tsconfig.json with appropriate settings
- [x] Create HTML file with responsive Canvas setup
- [x] Implement basic game loop structure
- [x] Add CSS for responsive design

### ✅ Phase 3: Game Engine Foundation
- [x] Create GameState manager for different states
- [x] Implement Canvas renderer with scaling
- [x] Add Input manager for keyboard and touch
- [x] Create basic collision detection system
- [x] Set up entity management system

### ✅ Phase 4: Game Entities
- [x] Implement Player (Pacman) class with movement
- [x] Create Maze class with collision boundaries
- [x] Add Pellet and PowerPellet classes
- [x] Implement basic game entity rendering
- [x] Add entity animation and visual effects

### ✅ Phase 5: Game Logic
- [x] Implement scoring system
- [x] Add level progression mechanics
- [x] Create game state transitions (start, pause, game over)
- [x] Implement win/lose conditions
- [x] Add pellet collection mechanics

### ✅ Phase 6: Polish and Optimization
- [x] Optimize performance for mobile devices
- [x] Fine-tune responsive design across screen sizes
- [x] Add visual effects and polish
- [x] Implement accessibility features
- [x] Test thoroughly on different devices

### ✅ Phase 7: Documentation and Cleanup
- [x] Update agent-memory-bank.md with final implementation details
- [x] Add code comments and documentation
- [x] Take screenshots for PR demonstration
- [x] Clean up any temporary files
- [x] Final testing and validation

## Technical Decisions Made

### Build Setup
- **TypeScript**: Using vanilla TypeScript with ES modules for simplicity
- **No Framework**: Keeping dependencies minimal following project conventions
- **Canvas Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas for performance and compatibility
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout, Canvas scaling for game

## Current Issues
- None identified yet

## Next Steps
1. Set up TypeScript build environment
2. Create basic HTML and CSS structure
3. Implement core game loop and canvas setup
4. Begin entity implementation starting with Player

## Time Estimation
- **Remaining**: ~4-6 hours of focused development
- **Complexity**: Medium (canvas-based game with responsive design)
- **Risk Level**: Low (well-established game mechanics)

## Notes
- Prioritizing mobile responsiveness as per quality standards
- Keeping code modular and under 1,500 lines per file
- Following TypeScript conventions throughout
- Will update this document as progress is made
