## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Single File Implementation**: Keeping HTML, CSS, and TypeScript in one file for simplicity
- **CSS Grid**: Using CSS Grid for the game board layout
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Inline TypeScript that compiles to JavaScript in browser
- **No Framework**: Vanilla implementation to avoid dependencies

### Design Decisions
- **Mobile First**: Starting with mobile design and scaling up
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for accessibility
- **Color Scheme**: Modern, high-contrast colors for accessibility
- **Typography**: System fonts for performance and consistency

## Files Created
- `/tic-tac-toe.html` - Complete game implementation
- `/docs/features/tic-tac-toe-specification.md` - Feature specification
- `/docs/tasks/050924-tic-tac-toe-implementation.md` - This task file
- `/docs/architecture/tic-tac-toe-architecture.md` - Technical architecture (to be created)

## Next Steps
1. Create the main HTML file with complete implementation
2. Test thoroughly across devices and browsers
3. Document the final architecture
4. Update project documentation
