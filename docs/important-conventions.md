## General Conventions
- Always use typesafe languages when available. When using javascript always use typescript.
- If existing standards for testing, authentication, api key storage, etc are used in the project than follow them consistently instead of trying to introduce new ones

## File Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `file-name.md`
- Be descriptive and specific: `auth-standards.md` not `auth.md`
- Include version dates for major updates: `api-v2-2024.md`
- Use consistent prefixes for related files: `perf-optimization.md`, `perf-benchmarks.md`

## Content Guidelines

### File Size Limits
- Maximum 1500 lines per file
- Split large documents into logical sections
- Use cross-references between related files

### Format Standards
- Use Markdown format (.md)
- Include clear headings and table of contents
- Use consistent formatting across all documents
- Include last updated dates and change logs

### Cross-References
- Link related documents using relative paths
- Maintain bidirectional references where appropriate
- Use consistent link text and formatting
