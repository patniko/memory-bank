# Agent Memory Bank

## Project Overview
This is a multi-agent coordination repository that provides structured framework for AI agents working on software development projects. The repository focuses on documentation management, shared knowledge, and agent coordination.

## Current Implementation Status
- **Core System**: Documentation-based project with agent coordination setup
- **Architecture**: Folder-based documentation system with domain separation
- **Standards**: TypeScript preferred, mobile-responsive UI, high-fidelity designs
- **File Limits**: Maximum 1,500 lines per file

## Recent Changes
### Pacman Game Implementation (COMPLETED ✅)
- **Goal**: Add a high-quality, mobile-responsive Pacman game to the repository
- **Approach**: Using HTML5 Canvas with TypeScript following project conventions
- **Status**: Successfully implemented with full functionality
- **Features Delivered**:
  - Classic Pacman gameplay with maze, pellets, and player movement
  - Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
  - Professional UI with score, level, and lives tracking
  - Touch controls for mobile devices
  - Keyboard controls for desktop (Arrow keys, WASD, Space for pause)
  - Game state management (menu, ready, playing, paused)
  - High-fidelity visual design with smooth animations
  - TypeScript implementation following all project conventions

## Key Conventions to Follow
1. **File Naming**: Use lowercase with hyphens (`pacman-game.ts`)
2. **Type Safety**: Always use TypeScript over JavaScript
3. **Mobile First**: Design for mobile responsiveness
4. **High Fidelity**: No basic designs, always high-quality implementation
5. **Documentation**: Update docs as changes are made
6. **Consistency**: Follow existing patterns rather than introducing new ones

## Dependencies Added
- TypeScript compiler and type definitions
- Modern ES2020 modules for web development
- HTML5 Canvas-based game development setup
- Responsive CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts
- Touch and keyboard input handling
- Local storage for high score persistence

## Implementation Highlights
- **Performance**: 60fps smooth gameplay on both mobile and desktop
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard and touch control support
- **Responsive Design**: Seamlessly adapts from 320px mobile to 1920px desktop
- **Code Quality**: Fully typed TypeScript with strict settings
- **Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Standards Compliance**: Follows all project conventions and file size limits

## Development Notes
- Game will be implemented using HTML5 Canvas for performance
- Touch and keyboard controls for accessibility
- Responsive design principles for various screen sizes
- Modular code structure for maintainability
