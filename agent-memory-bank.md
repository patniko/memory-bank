# Agent Memory Bank

## Project Overview
This repository provides a structured framework for coordinating multiple AI coding agents on software development projects. It establishes clear conventions, shared knowledge management, and agent-specific guidance to enable efficient collaborative development.

## Current Implementation Status
- **Active Feature**: âœ… Tic-Tac-Toe Game Implementation COMPLETED
- **Technology Stack**: HTML/CSS/TypeScript (single-file implementation)
- **Architecture**: Single-page web application
- **Design Requirements**: âœ… Mobile responsive, high fidelity UI
- **File**: `/tic-tac-toe.html` - Complete functional game

## Critical Development Guidelines

### File Organization
- Maximum 1,500 lines per file
- Use lowercase with hyphens for file names (`tic-tac-toe.html`)
- Logical grouping in discoverable folder structure
- Self-contained implementation preferred

### Technical Standards
- **Language Preference**: TypeScript over JavaScript
- **UI Requirements**: Mobile responsive, high fidelity design
- **Code Quality**: Follow existing patterns consistently
- **Documentation**: Update docs/ folder structure as needed

## Current Task Context
**Implementing Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
- Web-based game with modern, polished UI
- Mobile-first responsive design
- TypeScript for game logic
- Single-file implementation for simplicity
- No external dependencies required

## Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Single-Page Application**: Keeps implementation simple and self-contained
2. **Mobile-First Design**: Ensures accessibility across devices
3. **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and better development experience
4. **CSS Grid/Flexbox**: Modern layout techniques for responsive design

## Documentation Requirements
- Create feature specification in docs/features/
- Document task progress in docs/tasks/
- Update architecture documentation if needed
- Maintain this memory bank with important context

## Testing Approach
- Manual testing across different screen sizes
- Verify game logic correctness
- Ensure responsive design works properly
- Validate TypeScript compilation

## Completion Criteria
- [x] Functional tic-tac-toe game
- [x] Mobile responsive design
- [x] High fidelity UI
- [x] Clean, maintainable code
- [x] Proper documentation following project structure
